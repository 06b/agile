title:  "2. Everyone owns the problem"
---

Define the actual problem you are solving. Everyone on the team needs to understand who will use your solution and why. For example, any time a developer writes a line of code, they should be aware of how that change will impact the end user and how it relates to the other features of the application in meeting the overall goal of the project. Every team member should be able to connect the work they do every day to the solution you are creating together.

Every member of the team, periodically throughout the product development cycle, should have the opportunity to hear from people in your target audience and understand first-hand about the problems you are trying to solve.  The UK Government Digitial Service recommends developers shadow a user researcher for [2 hours every 6 weeks](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2014/08/28/how-to-be-a-better-user-researcher-shadow-2-hours-every-6-weeks/).  Increased [exposure hours](https://articles.uie.com/user_exposure_hours/) are the fastest path to success â€” consider your "users" as part of your team.

The principle, _everyone owns the problem_, applies on a large and small scale. Broadly, this applies to the key problem you are solving with the whole project, and narrowly this applies to any problem that anyone on the team encounters. Each person on the team should be encouraged to speak up if they see a problem or an opportunity for a better solution.

For example:

* A user research expert will develop an overall plan and strategy for gathering information from the target audience, but every team member should conduct user interviews and observe usability tests.
* Everyone participates in design ideation (design studios, idea sketching).
* Daily standups and regular retrospectives provide an opportunity for anyone to raise and solve issues.
* In sprint planning, the whole team reviews stories, breaking down use cases into small user-facing stories.
* Team members self-assign stories, according to their own skills and availability, always working on the highest priority task.
* A different person who worked on the story closes it. For user-facing stories, ideally a customer or team member representing the customer. Merging a pull request is not the same as accepting a story.
